# ecs-platformer

Super simple platformer built with ECS(enTT) and Physics(Box2D). The goal of this project was to get the understanding of how to work with ECS and physics engines as well as how to abstract them.
At the beginning, it was a 2d game engine (and it still is) but because I need to show something in the preview, it was converted into simple platformer which is using all avaliable features and is used as a sandbox for testing.

Engine avaliable features:
- ECS,
- Physics engine implemented on top of box2d and integrated into engine's ECS,
- Renderer based on OpenGL,
- Assets loader and packager,
- Scenes and Scene managment (You can create new scenes and load them at any moment of executing),
- Can be built for Windows and probably Linux (linux build is not tested)
